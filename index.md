# The idea is simple. When you start your meeting, give the first 5 minutes back.

That's it. Join the **#FirstFiveMinutes** club!

## 4 Simple Steps

1. Schedule your meeting as normal.
2. Share your screen, load [this image](/assets/images/sharescreen.png), then mute yourself.
3. Use the five minutes to improve your well being.
4. Un-mute and have great meeting.

## Why
- Back to back meetings happen.
- [Meeting fatigue](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/reduce-meeting-fatigue-f44be8a1-1bb4-4d02-8bc3-6bfd83ef3b5b) is real.
- Work/Meetings often expand to fill the time available for them - [Parkinson's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_law).
- It's easier to start late, than stop early, especially if it's a good conversation.
- It's a nice thing to do.

## Alternatives
- Schedule shorter meetings?
	- [Outlook lets you do this]((https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/end-meetings-early-or-start-late-ebb4c4c9-6992-4ea7-9772-8b5883df8500)), but only on Windows.
	- Someone might schedule into that gap!
- Have less meetings / no meeting days. 
	- This is a great idea.

## Contribute
This is not my idea, I think. I am sure I heard it somewhere else, but I made an image for it using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/), and then this website. It's hosted on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/), using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - which means it's very easy for anyone to [help](https://github.com/a-c-m/firstfiveminutes/issues) with ideas, designs, spelling fixes etc.
There is probably a lot of research/ideas in this space, please share them (ideally with a [PR](https://github.com/a-c-m/firstfiveminutes/pulls)) and I will update this page.

**Be the change you want to see in your workplace/industry/world.**
