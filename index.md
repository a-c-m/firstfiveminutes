*The idea here is simple, when you start your meeting, give the first 5 minutes back.*

That's it. Join the #FirstFiveMinutes club!

## 4 Simple Steps

1. Schedule your meeting as normal
2. Share your screen, load [this image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105557/116999002-f3e85300-acd6-11eb-886a-369229f73c57.png), then mute yourself
3. Use the 5 minutes you now have to improve your well being
4. Un-mute and have great meeting

## Why
- Back to back meetings happen
- [Meeting fatigue](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/reduce-meeting-fatigue-f44be8a1-1bb4-4d02-8bc3-6bfd83ef3b5b) is real
- Work/Meetings often expand to fill the time available for them - [Parkinson's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_law)
- Its easier to start late, than stop early, especially if its a good conversation
- Its a nice thing to do

## Alternatives
- Schedule shorter meetings?
	- [Outlook lets you do this]((https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/end-meetings-early-or-start-late-ebb4c4c9-6992-4ea7-9772-8b5883df8500)), but only on Windows.
	- Someone might schedule into that gap!
- Have less meetings / no meeting days 
	- This is a great idea
- ... ? 

## Contribute
This was an idea I heard, so I made an image for it using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/), and then this website. Its hosted on [github pages](https://pages.github.com/), using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - which means its very easy for anyone to [help](https://github.com/a-c-m/firstfiveminutes/issues) with ideas, designs, spelling fixes etc.
There is probably a lot of research/ideas in this space, please share them (ideally with a [PR](https://github.com/a-c-m/firstfiveminutes/pulls)) and I will update this page.

Be the change you want to see in your workplace/industry/world.
